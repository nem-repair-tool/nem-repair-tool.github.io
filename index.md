<!-- # Automated Program Repair using Formal Specifications. -->

## Abstract
  We present an automated approach to repair programs using formal
  verification and expression templates. In our approach, an input program
  is first verified against its formal specification to discover
  potentially buggy statements. For each of these statements, we identify
  the expression that needs to be repaired and set up a template patch
  which is a linear expression composed of the program's variables and
  unknown coefficients. Then, we analyze the template-patched program
  against its specification to collect a set of constraints of the template
  patch. This constraint set will be solved by a constraint solving
  technique using Farkas' lemma to identify the unknown coefficients,
  consequently discovering the patch. We implement our approach in a tool
  called **maple** and evaluate it with various buggy programs from a widely
  used benchmark **TCAS** as well as a synthetic, yet challenging benchmark
  containing recursive programs. Our tool outperforms state-of-the-art
  program repair tools in returning desired patches.

## Maple
Maple is build on top of the [HIP](http://loris-5.d2.comp.nus.edu.sg/hip/index.html)
verification system and [Songbird](https://songbird-prover.github.io/) prover. 

## Compared Tools
- [AllRepair](https://github.com/batchenRothenberg/AllRepair)
- [Forensic](http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/agra/eng/forensic.php)
- [Angelix](https://github.com/mechtaev/angelix) - The experiments are done with
  the provided VirtualBox image.
- [GenProg](https://github.com/squaresLab/genprog-code)

## The Benchmarks and Experiments.
- The test suites for the *TCAS* benchmark is provided by Xianglong Kong. You
  can download by this [link](files/genprog-demo.zip). The benchmark contains 41
  buggy cases. Each case has its own test suite of 40 tests.
- The details about the second benchmark is provided
in [Github](https://github.com/maple-repair/recursive-benchmark).
- The experiments of AllRepair and Forensic are done with the same format which
  uses an assertion that compares the results of buggy and correct programs,
  e.g. assert(buggy\_sum(x, y) == correct\_sum(x,y)
- For GenProg and Angelix, we create test suites of 10 for each buggy program in
  the second experiment. We follow their tutorials in setting up this experiment.
